                <h2> Setup </h2>
                <p>
                    This project has been tested running PHP 5.6.13 for Windows.
                    It is started by navigating to the root and using the command <span class="label label-info">php -S localhost:8000</span>.
                    The folder <span class="label label-info">root</span> is treated as the document root.
                    The site can then be found by going to <span class="label label-info">localhost:8000</span> in the browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also running on a CentOS 7 server being served by Apache. The url for this version is <a href="http://php.landonia.me/SimplePHPUpload">http://php.landonia.me/SimplePHPUpload</a>
                </p>
                <hr />
                <h2> Operation </h2>
                <div>
                    <h4> Home Page </h4>
                    <p>
                        The index page will allow users to choose a file (image) to upload and submit.
                        It will also pick up a URL parameter with <span class="label label-info">fileName=</span> and try to find an image in upload by that name to display. <br />
                        This home page also features a slider at the bottom which displays all of the uploaded images in all of their uploady glory. It checks for updates every 5 seconds and rebuilds if necessary.
                    </p>
                    <h4> Processing Page </h4>
                    <p>
                        This is the page the form submits back to.
                        It will run some validation on the file (size/extension) and display error messages with a link back to the form if necessary.
                        If there are no issues, the javascript will pick up and redirect back to the home page with the url parameter <span class="label label-info">?fileName=</span> and the name of the uploaded file.
                        This allows the home page to display the uploaded image back to the user.
                    </p>
